# FBP Codex Booster

![Generated customer management demo](docs/images/customer-demo.png)

> Get Codex building structured PHP business apps in minutes.

FBP Codex Booster is a ready-to-run PHP app base for Codex. Instead of asking
Codex to design everything from scratch, FBP gives it a working structure from
the first prompt.

It gives Codex a predictable place to create screens, data flows, business
actions, public pages, cron jobs, webhooks, and verification commands.

It is not another Laravel competitor. Think of it as a booster kit for AI coding:
clone it, run it, start Codex inside it, and ask Codex to build business app
features in a controlled shape.

## Try It Now

Requirements:

- PHP 8+
- Git

Run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/focusbp/fbp-codex-booster.git
cd fbp-codex-booster
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 router.php
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

You should see the FBP login screen.

If port `8000` is already in use:

```bash
php -S 127.0.0.1:8001 router.php
```

### Windows / WSL2

On Windows, use WSL2 for the best Codex CLI experience.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install php-cli git nodejs npm
npm install -g @openai/codex

git clone https://github.com/focusbp/fbp-codex-booster.git
cd fbp-codex-booster
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 router.php
```

## Start Codex

Open another terminal and start Codex from the repository root:

```bash
cd fbp-codex-booster
codex
```

## Make Samples

Use these prompts to have Codex generate working sample apps from the bundled
skills and assets. Start with the customer sample, then add more samples as
needed.

### Customer Management

Copy the whole block below and paste it into Codex:

```text
Read README.md and fbp/docs/.agents/skills/fbp-customer-demo/SKILL.md.
Create the default customer management demo.
Use the bundled installer and assets from the skill.
Verify the CRUD screen, seed data, CSV export, and PDF output with the FBP CLI.
```

### Event Registration

Copy the whole block below and paste it into Codex:

```text
Read README.md, fbp/docs/.agents/skills/fbp-app-samples/SKILL.md, fbp/docs/.agents/skills/fbp-app-samples/references/event-registration.md, and fbp/docs/.agents/skills/fbp-app-samples/references/event-registration-db.md.
Create the Event Registration sample.
Run the bundled installer: php fbp/docs/.agents/skills/fbp-app-samples/scripts/install_event_registration.php.
Install the event_sessions and event_registrations DBs, registration status options, event session management screen, participants side panel with add/delete/status actions, public registration page, and admin public URL dialog.
Do not add project linkage, public registration history, public cancellation, external calendar sync, email sending, or credentials.
Verify the admin screen, public registration URL dialog, public registration page, DB schema, seed data, and PHP syntax with the FBP CLI.
```

### Schedule Appointment

Copy the whole block below and paste it into Codex:

```text
Read README.md, fbp/docs/.agents/skills/fbp-app-samples/SKILL.md, fbp/docs/.agents/skills/fbp-app-samples/references/schedule-appointment.md, and fbp/docs/.agents/skills/fbp-app-samples/references/schedule-appointment-db.md.
Create the Schedule Appointment sample.
Run the bundled installer: php fbp/docs/.agents/skills/fbp-app-samples/scripts/install_schedule_appointment.php.
Install the schedule_appointment_slots DB, booked/blocked/cancelled appointment status options, logged-in-user scoped weekly admin schedule screen, per-user public URL dialog, and public appointment calendar.
Public Select buttons should appear only on empty future 30-minute cells; existing non-cancelled schedule rows should appear as Busy.
Do not add external calendar sync, email sending, payment, public cancellation, customer login, or credentials.
Verify the admin calendar, public URL dialog, public calendar, empty-cell booking flow, DB schema, seed data, and PHP syntax with the FBP CLI.
```

### LINE Bot Basic

Copy the whole block below and paste it into Codex:

```text
Read README.md, fbp/docs/.agents/skills/fbp-app-samples/SKILL.md, and fbp/docs/.agents/skills/fbp-webhook/SKILL.md.
Create the LINE Bot basic sample.
Run the bundled installer: php fbp/docs/.agents/skills/fbp-app-samples/scripts/install_line_bot_basic.php.
Install the line_member DB, member_type options, line_webhook receiver, basic webhook_rule action classes, public profile page, and LINE member management screen.
Do not add LINE secrets or tokens to code.
Verify the LINE member management screen, webhook_rule list, DB schema, and PHP syntax with the FBP CLI.
```

## Generated Customer Demo

After the customer prompt above, Codex creates a customer management demo with
CRUD, CSV import/export, and PDF output.

![Generated customer PDF output](docs/images/customer-demo-pdf.png)

## Generated Event Registration Sample

After the Event Registration prompt above, Codex creates a no-external-service
event registration demo with `event_sessions`, `event_registrations`, an admin event session management
screen, a participants side panel with add/delete/status actions, a public registration page, and a dialog that
shows the public registration URL.

The public registration path is:

```text
/event_registration_public*page
```

## Generated Schedule Appointment Sample

After the Schedule Appointment prompt above, Codex creates a one-note appointment
booking demo with `schedule_appointment_slots`, a weekly admin schedule calendar scoped to the
logged-in user, a public URL dialog with encrypted `user.id`, and a public booking calendar where
empty future cells can be selected and existing non-cancelled schedules are shown as busy.

The public appointment path is:

```text
/schedule_appointment_public*calendar&user=<encrypted-user-id>
```

## Generated LINE Bot Basic Sample

After the LINE Bot Basic prompt above, Codex creates a minimal LINE Bot base
with `line_member`, `line_webhook`, `webhook_rule` records, a public profile
page, and a LINE member management screen.

Configure LINE credentials in app settings, then set the LINE Messaging API
webhook path to:

```text
/line_webhook*receive
```

## Deploy To Apache

Upload these folders to the same parent directory on your Apache server:

```text
/path/to/site/
  fbp/
  classes/
```

- `fbp/` contains the framework runtime, `app.php`, assets, and `.htaccess`.
- `classes/` contains generated app code, app data, and logs.
- `.git/`, `nbproject/`, and local editor files are not needed on the server.
- `docs/`, `README.md`, and `router.php` are not required for Apache runtime.

Recommended Apache setup:

```text
DocumentRoot /path/to/site
```

Then open:

```text
https://example.com/fbp/app.php
```

If the app is installed under a subdirectory, keep `fbp/` and `classes/` under
the same parent directory:

```text
https://example.com/subdir/fbp/app.php
```

Make sure the PHP process can write to `classes/data` and `classes/log`.
The bundled `fbp/.htaccess` sets `app.php` as the directory index and blocks
web access to `cli.php`.

## What Codex Can Build Here

- CRUD screens for internal tools
- Customer, order, task, and workflow management
- Dashboards and admin panels
- Public pages and forms
- Webhooks and cron automation
- Email, PDF, API, LINE, and Square-connected workflows

## Why This Exists

Codex can generate code, but business applications require repeatable patterns.

FBP Codex Booster provides those patterns: routes, screens, actions, data
handling, verification commands, and skills.

The goal is not to replace developers. The goal is to give Codex a stable
environment where it can build useful business features without starting from
zero every time.
